This mod is a simple reimplementation of the FOSS Vajra from GregTech: New Horizon's GT5-Unofficial mod for Minecraft 1.12.2. It is designed to be minimal while being extensible. It is only meant to be a tool that breaks blocks fast. Due to this, it has no additional damage when attacking enemies (unlike the original). By using the tool (right click by default) while looking at the air, you can toggle the silk touch mode. This mode just adds a silk touch enchantment to the tool, so it should behave the same as an enchanted pickaxe. Vajras cannot be enchanted, so mods should not be able to strip this enchantment into a book (assuming they respect this flag).

There is a system for extending the right click action, and this mod comes with integrations for Applied Energistics 2 and Ender IO by default. Right clicking an AE2 cable will remove individual parts. Right clicking an Ender IO conduit will remove individual conduits. The API for this can be found in `src/main/java/vajra/api`.

This mod has no external dependencies, but Vajras require power to function so some method of generating energy is required. There are also some simple recipes included in this mod so that it can be added to custom packs without needing any tweaks, but these can be disabled easily by setting the `Add Vajra Recipes` config to false.
